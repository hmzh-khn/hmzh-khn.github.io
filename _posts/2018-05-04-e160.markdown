*Everything described in this post was developed as a partnership between myself and James Palmer HMC '18. He deserves half the credit for it all.*

This past semester, my friend James Palmer and I been in Autonomous Robotic Navigation, a class covering the control, localization, and motion planning of mobile robots. We've been using the Pololu Romi robot to implement a number of robotic algorithms, including point tracking, odometry, particle filtering, and probabilistic road maps. Our code for this class is available on [Github][code].

For our final project for the class, we designed and implemented an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). 

We gave a presentation ([slides][paper-pres]) on the UKF, as [designed by Uhlmann][paper] in the early 2000s. After implementing it, we gave a presentation ([slides][final-pres]) on our implementation of it on the Pololu Romi.

Here's a [video][UKF-control-vid] of the UKF working to control a Pololu Romi robot!
