Well, I finally went and made a website. Here it is. It's a bit empty for now, 
but more content is on the way soon! In the meantime, feel free to check out my 
[resume][resume] and [LinkedIn][linkedin] and my projects on [Github][github] 
and [YouTube][youtube].

My name is Hamzah Khan. I'm a Muslim American from Santa Rosa, CA and raised in 
Portland, OR. I'm a junior computer science and engineering student at Harvey 
Mudd College, interested in microprocessor systems design and artifical 
intelligence. I'm especially interested in projects that combine both.
